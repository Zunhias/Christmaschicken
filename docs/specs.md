# Specifications for the automatic Christmaschicken door

## General
Chicken are commonly known to be eaten, not only by humans, but also by wildlife animals, like foxes or martens. In this case, chicken are less likely to lay eggs and thus loose their production value to the community.

In nature, chicken and other birds try to protect themselves from predators - which are usually night active animals - by climbing trees at nightfall. Often enough, this tatcic proves to be ineffective.

A better way of protecting livestock at night is locking them in a shack. Luckily, one of those shacks happens to exist in our mom's garden, which has proven to be an effective barrier between the chicken and the predators (other than humans). The downside of this shack is that it operates only manually.

Until now, the relatively simple labour of locking and unlocking the shack is done by qualified workers, which is raising the production costs of chicken and eggs exorbitantly.

## Aim
In this project, an automised system shall be developed, where the manual labour of locking and unlocking the shack is replaced by an electro-mechanic device.

## Specifications
The device should be able to open and close a door, which is large enough for a chicken. Assuming spherical chicken in a vacuum, the door shoud have a minimal diameter of 30 cm.

The door should open at dawn and close at nightfall. Ideally, a sensor is detecting the amount of light and controlling the door accordingly.

The controller and the motor should not be able to exert much force to the door to prevent injuries.

Additionally, it should be possible to easily re-calibrate the light sensor e.g. with a specific button, as well as manually opening and closing the door e.g. also with buttons.
